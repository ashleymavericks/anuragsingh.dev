Iâ€™m Anurag, a backend developer and homelab enthusiast. The vast majority of my work is free and open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/ashleymavericks). 

Moreover, I'm the founder of [@hackclubnmit](https://github.com/hackclubnmit) and love building softwares, automating my workflows, self-hosting all my services on custom build personal servers (Raspberry Pi clusters with ICE Tower Cooler), developing algo-trading scripts, managing my entire life on Notion and reading a lot of newsletters on system design choices of big tech. From design to development I love the entire process of building software.

Most of my recent work is related to backend, but I like to dabble with anything related to software: frontend, web, system administration, augmented reality and more.
